When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is accessible from anywhere, so you can work from any computer anywhere in the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Other people may have updated your remote repository and added changes you don't want. By always pulling changes manually, you can make sure your local repository only has changes you want.
